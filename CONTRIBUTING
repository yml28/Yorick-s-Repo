########################################### Tire Tempurature Monitoring System ##########################################


# Abstract
the goal for this project is to construct a system of four thermo optical sensors to a car chasis to be able to look at 
live tire tempurature during operation. The system is comprised of 4 AMG8833 array sensors for each tire that come 
together to one arduino using addressed I2C locations. Once the data is gathered by the arduino it is displayed on a
custom screen implemented into a part of the heads up display. This could be potentially in a vent or custom frame. the 
contents of the screen will be able to show what tire is at what temp and map it to a color based on set limits. The 
display will also have the option to show a live view of a chosen tire by the press of a button.
